# Description
This repository holds the Eagle CAD PCB files for the LU Player Tracker board. You can find the code repository [here](https://github.com/HailStorm32/LU-Player-Tracker-Code). 

This board shows the player count and locations in real time by lighting up the respective world RGB LED and seven segment display. The player location and count is sent via MQTT from a Darkflame Universe private server. 

> Darkflame Universe is a server emulator for the defunct LEGO Universe MMO. You can find more info about the project [here](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer)
